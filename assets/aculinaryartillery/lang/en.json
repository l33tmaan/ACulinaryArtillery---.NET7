  "aculinaryartilleryguide-text": "<strong>A Culinary Artillery: Cooking 100 - Your Tools</strong><br><i>The font of creation</i><br><br><strong>Introduction</strong><br>This mod adds a variety of cooking tools and mechanics as a base for other cooking mods. You must install another mod, such as <a href=\"https://mods.vintagestory.at/expandedfoods\">Expanded Foods</a>, in order to fully utilize these tools. <br><br><strong>Overview of Mechanics</strong><br>An overview of all of the cooking techniques you can do, including base game cooking mechanics:<br><br><i>Bake</i> - Place an item in a preheated <a href=\"handbook://block-clayoven-north\">clay oven</a>.<br><br><i>Boil</i> - Place a <a href=\"handbook://block-aculinaryartillery:saucepan-raw\">saucepan</a> or <a href=\"handbook://block-aculinaryartillery:cauldron-iron\">cauldron</a> on a firepit and add a liquid and an ingredient to its top slots.<br><br><i>Cook</i> - Place ingredients in the upper slots of a firepit, <a href=\"handbook://block-claypot-burned\">cooking pot</a>, saucepan or cauldron.<br><br><i>Dry age</i> - Place the item on a <a href=\"handbook://block-aculinaryartillery:meathooks-aged-copper-east\">meat rack</a> with <hk>rightmouse</hk> click, then wait for it to dry age. Rotting items cannot age.<br><br><i>Knead</i> - Place ingredients in the top 6 slots of a <a href=\"handbook://block-aculinaryartillery:mixingbowl-normal\">mixing bowl</a> and <hk>rightmouse</hk> click to knead them together.<br><br><i>Mix</i> - Place an empty cooking pot in the lower-left slot of a mixing bowl, add your ingredients to the top 6 slots, and <hk>rightmouse</hk> click to mix them together.<br><br><i>Press</i> - Place a stack of items in the fruit press and <hk>rightmouse</hk> click to begin pressing. Don't forget the bucket!<br><br><strong>New Cooking Tools</strong><br>Use these new tools to prepare and preserve more complex meals.<br><br><strong><a href=\"handbook://block-aculinaryartillery:bottle-clay-burned\">Bottles</a></strong><br>Made from clay or glass, bottles hold liquids in the same manner as bowls and can be placed on shelves or in <a href=\"handbook://block-aculinaryartillery:bottlerack-acacia-acacia-north\">bottle racks</a>. Can be used to ferment drinks or for liquid consumption. Bottles <i>greatly</i> extend the lifespan of a liquid.<br><br><strong><a href=\"handbook://block-aculinaryartillery:meathooks-aged-copper-east\">Meat rack</a></strong><br>Items with the 'meathookable' attribute can be dried on a meat rack. This process ages the meat and boosts its nutritional value. Meat racks can also hold mini-cauldrons, saucepans and meat cleavers.<br><br><strong><a href=\"handbook://block-aculinaryartillery:mixingbowlmini\">Mixing bowl</a></strong><br>The mixing bowl is used for kneading ingredients and mixing meals. The mixing bowl can be <a href=\"handbook://block-aculinaryartillery:mixingbowl-normal\">mechanically powered</a>.<br><br>Lock the mixing bowl with <hk>CTRL</hk> + <hk>rightmouse</hk> click. When locked, it will only accept the ingredients that were in it, and in those specific slots. It cannot automatically accept liquids.<br><br><strong><a href=\"handbook://block-aculinaryartillery:saucepan-burned\">Saucepan</a></strong><br>Put the saucepan on a firepit and add a liquid and an ingredient to the top 6 slots. You can also cook food in the saucepan without a liquid, but it will turn out charred. Use the saucepan to cook solids down into liquids, or reduce liquids into solids.<br><br>The saucepan can also preserve liquids in ground storage. Scoop up the liquid with the saucepan (or use another container to pour liquid into it) and place it on the ground. Put a lid on with <hk>CTRL</hk> + <hk>SHIFT</hk> + <hk>rightmouse</hk> click.<br><br><strong><a href=\"handbook://block-aculinaryartillery:cauldron-copper\">Cauldron</a></strong><br>The cauldron is functionally identical to the saucepan, but it can hold a lot more. There's also a <a href=\"handbook://block-aculinaryartillery:cauldronmini-copper\">small sized version</a>.<br><br>Like the saucepan, the cauldron can also preserve liquids in ground storage. Scoop up the liquid with the cauldron (or use another container to pour liquid into it), put it on the ground and <hk>CTRL</hk> + <hk>SHIFT</hk> + <hk>rightmouse</hk> click to place a lid on it. Cauldrons significantly extend the lifespan of a liquid, but not for as long as a bottle can.<br><br><strong><a href=\"handbook://block-aculinaryartillery:spile-copper-north\">Spile</a></strong><br>Jam this into a tree and place a bucket or saucepan beneath it to collect fresh tree sap during certain times of the year. See the Expanded Foods mod for more details.<br><br><strong><a href=\"handbook://item-aculinaryartillery:rollingpin-maple\">Rolling pin</a></strong><br>Carved from logs or smithed, rolling pins are used to mechanically tenderize/flatten meat and roll out pasta dough. You can also try to mechanically tenderize live creatures, but it won't do much damage.<br><br><strong>Egg Changes</strong><br>Raw eggs as ingredients have been replaced by:<br><br>- Egg white<br>- Cracked egg<br>- Egg yolk<br>- Liquid egg<br>- Egg shells<br><br>Eggs must be cracked open before they can be used as ingredients in meals.<br><br>Crack an egg into a bowl or bucket with <hk>CTRL</hk> + <hk>rightmouse</hk> click to get 0.1 L of <a href=\"handbook://item-aculinaryartillery:eggwhiteportion\">egg white</a> and a <a href=\"handbook://item-aculinaryartillery:eggyolk-chicken\">cracked egg</a>. Crack the cracked egg again into another bowl for 0.1 L of <a href=\"handbook://item-aculinaryartillery:eggyolkportion-chicken\">egg yolk</a>. <br><br>Mix egg white and egg yolk together in a mixing bowl to make <a href=\"handbook://item-aculinaryartillery:eggyolkfullportion-chicken\">liquid egg</a>. Or, fully crack the egg into a regular bowl with <hk>CTRL</hk> + <hk>SHIFT</hk> + <hk>rightmouse</hk> click to get 0.1 L of liquid egg straightaway.<br><br>Cracking eggs creates <a href=\"handbook://item-aculinaryartillery:eggshell\">egg shells</a> as a byproduct, which can be used as fertilizer or animal feed. Recycle the shells by feeding them back to your chickens!",
