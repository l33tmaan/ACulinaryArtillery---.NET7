Through the labor of creation, infinite possibilies awaken. Once a mixing bowl is placed, <icon name='rightmousebutton'></icon> it in order to open the menu. There are 6 slots at the top - these are where ingredients are placed. The lower-right slot is the output slot, where finished foods or meals are placed. The lower-left slot is only used when mixing meals, and is reserved for the cooking pot.<br><i>NOTE</i>: To <b>'knead'</b> something is to create it in the mixing bowl without a cooking pot, outputting an item. To <b>'mix'</b> something is to create it in the mixing bowl WITH a cooking pot, outputting a meal.<br><br>Once your ingredients are placed, either hold <icon name='rightmousebutton'></icon> on the mixing bowl, or if you have a <a href=\"handbook://block-aculinaryartillery:poweredmixingbowl-blue-whitemarble\">powered mixing bowl</a> then you may utilize mechanical power through the bottom of the machine. This will start kneading your ingredients together. If your output slot is full, then the kneaded creation will be output directly next to the mixing bowl (hopefully into a <a href=\"handbook://block-hopper\">hopper</a> instead of the dirty ground).<br><br>Mixing meals works slightly differently. Unlike kneading foods (and like when creating meals in a cooking pot), a meal can only be mixed with exact ingredient proportions. In order to mix a meal, you MUST have a cooking pot in the lower-left slot, and it will ALWAYS be output into the lower-right slot - never dumped out of the mixing bowl. You can only have one cooking pot in an input/output slot at a time, they do not stack.<br><br><i>TIP</i>: You can click <hk>Ctrl</hk>+<icon name='rightmousebutton'></icon> on the top of the mixing bowl to \"lock\" its ingredients in place so they may not be changed.

  "craftinginfo-simmering-text": "<strong>Simmering</strong><br><i>What actually transpires beneath the veil of a cauldron lid? Decent people shouldn't think too much about that.</i><br><br>A wide world of culinary options is at your fingertips, once you learn how to throw something into a hot pot of water (or other liquids). In order to start simmering food, fire a <a href=\"handbook://block-aculinaryartillery:saucepan-blue-fired\">saucepan</a>. Alternately, cast a <a href=\"handbook://block-aculinaryartillery:cauldron-iron\">cauldron</a> or <a href=\"handbook://block-aculinaryartillery:cauldronmini-iron\">small cauldron</a> or purchase one from a Kitchenware Trader. Once you have your new cooking implement, place it into a firepit, this will add 4 \"simmering\" slots to the firepit inventory, similar to when <a href=\"handbook://craftinginfo-mealcooking\">making meals</a>. Simmering ALWAYS requires a liquid, and anywhere from 1 to 4 slots may be required to make a new food item.<br>All used slots must hold an equal amount of portion, and portion sizes for any given item may be found directly on the item's page, under the \"Created by Simmering\" section (see <a href=\"handbook://item-expandedfoods:gelatin-blueberry\">gelatin</a> for example).<br><br>A simmer container can output items in two different ways: Solid items will be placed into the output slot and may be directly grabbed with your hands, as your container remains in its slot. Liquid items are placed into your simmer container, which is then moved from the input slot on into the output slot and <b>must</b> be removed from that slot in order to be used further.",
