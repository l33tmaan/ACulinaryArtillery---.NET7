  "aculinaryartilleryguide-text": "<strong>A Culinary Artillery: Cooking 100 - Your Tools</strong><br><i>The font of creation</i><br><br><strong>Introduction</strong><br>This mod adds a variety of cooking utensils and mechanics that don't do anything on their own but require another mod such as Expanded Foods in order to fully utilize. This mod is ONLY a library for other mods!<br><br><strong>Syntax</strong><br>To eliminate confusion, certain vocabulary will be defined here. When a guide using A Culinary Artillery uses these words, they are in a direct and specific manner.<br><br><i>Bake</i> - Place an item in a hot clay oven.<br><i>Boil</i> - Place the items in a Saucepan or Cauldron on a hot firepit.<br><i>Cook</i> - Place an item in a firepit's upper slot.<br><i>Dry Age</i> - Place the item on a Meat Rack by right-clicking, then wait for it to dry age. If the meat starts to rot before aging, it will NOT age.<br><i>Knead</i> - Place items in the top 6 slots of the Mixing Bowl and right-click to output an item.<br><i>Mix</i> - Place a cooking pot in the lower-left slot of a Mixing Bowl, then add food to the top 6 slots and right-click to output a meal.<br><i>Press</i> - Place a stack of items in the Fruit Press and right-click to begin pressing.<br><br><i>Expanded Food</i> - A special kind of food that can have multiple nutrition types.<br><br><strong><i>NEW COOKING BLOCKS</i></strong><br><br><strong><a href=\"handbook://block-aculinaryartillery:bottle-clay-burned\">Bottles</a></strong><br>Made from clay or glass, bottles are capable of holding liquids in the same manner as bowls and can be placed in the world or on shelves or <a href=\"handbook://block-aculinaryartillery:bottlerack-acacia-acacia-north\">bottle racks</a>. Can be used to ferment drinks or for liquid consumption.<br><strong><a href=\"handbook://block-aculinaryartillery:meathooks-aged-copper-east\">Meat Rack</a></strong><br>Items with the 'meathookable' attribute can be Dried on a meat rack. This process ages the meat and boosts its nutritional value. Non-food items can be hung from the rack, such as mini-cauldrons, saucepans, and meat cleavers.<br><strong><a href=\"handbook://block-aculinaryartillery:mixingbowl-normal\">Mixing Bowl</a></strong><br>Vital for creating many Expanded Foods. Can take 6 slots of food or liquid, then Knead it together into a new item. Placing a pot into it allows you to Mix certain meals. It can be mechanically powered by connecting an axle to the top or bottom of the block.<br>The mixing bowl can be locked with CTRL + Right Click on the bowl. When locked, it will only accept the ingredients that were in it, and in those specific slots. It cannot automatically accept liquids.<br><strong><a href=\"handbook://block-aculinaryartillery:saucepan-raw\">Saucepan</a></strong><br>Functions somewhat similarly to a bucket, but you can place it onto a firepit to Boil the liquids inside. In order to Boil something in the saucepan, it must be placed into its slots. It is capable of turning some solids into liquids, and turning some liquids into solids. Press CTRL + SHIFT + Right Click to place a lid on it, slightly increasing the lifespan of liquids within.<br><strong><a href=\"handbook://block-aculinaryartillery:cauldron-iron\">Cauldron</a></strong><br>The cauldron is a larger version of the saucepan and is also used to Boil liquids. It is created by pouring liquid metal into a clay cauldron mold. You can also place a lid on the cauldron, but it is more effective than the saucepan's lid.<br><strong><a href=\"handbook://block-aculinaryartillery:spile-copper-north\">Spile</a></strong><br>Jam this into a tree and place a bucket or saucepan beneath it to collect sap from the tree during certain times of the year... if another mod is installed<br><br><strong><i>NEW COOKING ITEMS</i></strong><br><br><strong><a href=\"handbook://item-aculinaryartillery:rollingpin-maple\">Rolling Pin</a></strong><br>Carved from logs or smithed, rolling pins can be used to flatten foods such as meat and pasta dough. They are also a weak weapon.<br><br><strong>EGG CHANGES</strong><br>Any egg can be cracked into a bowl or bucket. Partially cracking it results in 0.1 L of <strong><a href=\"handbook://item-aculinaryartillery:eggwhiteportion\">Liquid Egg White</a></strong> and an <strong><a href=\"handbook://item-aculinaryartillery:eggyolk-chicken\">Egg Yolk</a></strong> item, which can be cracked again for 0.1 L of <strong><a href=\"handbook://item-aculinaryartillery:eggyolkportion-chicken\">Liquid Egg Yolk</a></strong>. These can be used as breading and will have more uses in the future. You can mix these liquids or fully crack an egg to get 0.1 L of <strong><a href=\"handbook://item-aculinaryartillery:eggyolkfullportion-chicken\">Liquid Egg</a></strong>, which is used in place of raw eggs in many recipes. Once an egg is cracked, it results in <strong><a href=\"handbook://item-aculinaryartillery:eggshell\">Eggshells</a></strong>, which can be used as fertilizer or animal feed.<br>Press CTRL+click to partially crack an egg and CTRL+SHIFT+click to fully crack it.",
